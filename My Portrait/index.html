		All through, my days at school
I often think of you, my darling baby boo
Your always in my head, that's why I can't wait to go to bed
To close my eyes and visualize
You right by my side
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up, please don't wake me up
We're walking hand in hand in Disneyland
Then we're at the grand canyon, soon we'll be on the moon
That afternoon walking on the sand
My Hawaiian baby girl, in my dreams your always near

Oh my girl we can go anywhere
Just say the place and I'll take you there
'Cause in this dream I can be your King, and you my love
You can be my queen
